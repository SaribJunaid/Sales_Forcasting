# Sales_Forcasting
This repository contains the code for a sales forecasting model developed to predict future sales based on historical data. The model utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze trends and patterns in the sales data and generate forecasts for future time periods.

Key Features:
Utilizes historical sales data to train the model.
Incorporates time-related features such as day, month, quarter, and year.
Applies regression algorithms to learn the relationship between sales and other variables.
Generates forecasts for future time periods based on learned patterns.
Evaluation Metrics:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the average absolute difference between predicted and actual sales values.

Usage:
Load the historical sales data into the model.
Train the model using the provided training data.
Generate forecasts for future time periods using the trained model.
Evaluate the performance of the model using the provided evaluation metrics.
Dependencies:
Python 3.x
Scikit-learn
Pandas
Matplotlib
